# Tic-Tac-Toe React Project

Welcome to my exciting React project - the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe with a
modern twist! In this interactive web application, I've meticulously crafted a
dynamic gaming experience that allows you to enjoy the timeless game while
exploring the power of React.

## Key Features:

### Gameboard State:

My project boasts a responsive gameboard that intelligently tracks the status of
each of the nine cells. Every move you make is carefully recorded, and you'll
always know the current state of the game.

### Player Messages:

To keep you engaged, I've integrated two types of messages. One informs you
whose turn it is, ensuring you're always in the loop. The other announces the
winner when the game is won, so you can revel in victory or graciously accept
defeat.

### Winning Conditions:

No more arguing about who won - our Tic-Tac-Toe game has got you covered. It
detects winning combinations automatically, saving you the hassle of manually
checking the board after every move.

### Player Turns:

We've implemented a seamless player turn system. Click on a cell, and it will
change color to represent the player whose turn it is, making the game intuitive
and visually appealing.

### Handler Functions:

Behind the scenes, I've crafted two robust handler functions. One manages the
click functionality of each cell, while the other assists by altering the
element's class to reflect the player's choice.

### UseEffect for Scoring:

As an added bonus, my project includes a useEffect hook that calculates the
score after every player's move. It keeps track of wins and ties, providing a
comprehensive gaming experience.

Get ready to embark on a nostalgic journey through the world of Tic-Tac-Toe,
enhanced with the capabilities of React. Challenge your friends, test your
strategy, and have fun as you explore the code and functionalities that bring
this classic game to life.

May the best player win!
